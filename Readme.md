# Task Tracker


## Overview

Task Tracker is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application built using Node.js. It helps you manage your tasks by allowing you to add, update, delete, and list tasks. You can also mark tasks as in-progress or completed. This project uses a JSON file to store task data and leverages the built-in Node.js fs (File System) and path modules.

## Features

- Add New Tasks: Easily add tasks with a description.
- Update Tasks: Modify the description of an existing task.
- Delete Tasks: Remove tasks by their ID.
- List Tasks: View all tasks or filter them by status (to-do, in-progress, done).
- Mark Tasks: Mark tasks as completed or in-progress.
- Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in a JSON file, ensuring data is saved even after the program exits.
